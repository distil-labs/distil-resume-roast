The bullet points are jam‑packed with percentages and dollar signs (“reducing overall weight by 18 %,” “saving $210 K annually”) but they never tell us *how* you accomplished those miracles, making them sound more like fantasy numbers than real engineering stories. And, of course, you end with the ever‑so‑original “References provided upon request,” as if you’re secretly hoping the recruiter will notice that you’re too busy to even list them. Nice work on the buzz‑word buffet, but it leaves a hiring manager wondering whether they’re reading a résumé or a corporate‑speak bingo card."",
