Opening with “Dynamic marketing professional” feels like you’re auditioning for a hype‑man role, and the phrase “up to 45%” in your summary is about as precise as a weather forecast. Your “Senior Marketing Manager” bullet points are stuffed with big numbers—$3.2 M revenue increase, 3.2× ROAS, 38% time cut—yet you completely forget to tell us *how* you did it, leaving the reader guessing if you just waved a magic wand. The older roles sound like you were busy “producing SEO‑optimized copy” and “coordinating trade shows” without any proof that those activities actually moved the needle. And “References: Available upon request” is the résumé equivalent of “I’m not lazy, I’m just delegating,” which is frankly the most over‑used line in the industry. Good luck standing out when hiring managers are already snoozing after the first paragraph."",

You start with a generic “Creative UX/UI Designer … shaping intuitive digital experiences” line that could belong to anyone with a portfolio, then you pepper the document with buzzwords like “component‑driven design system” and “Heuristic Evaluation score > 8.0” without ever explaining why those numbers matter. The portfolio URL “lena‑patel.io” is missing the https:// prefix, as if you expect recruiters to guess the protocol. Your “References: Available upon request” line is the digital equivalent of a handshake that never happened, and you list a perfect 4.0 GPA from MIT but forget to mention any real‑world impact beyond percentages. All those impressive percentages (94 % task success, 22‑point NPS jump, 35 % dev‑time cut) are presented without any context about the problem you solved or the baseline, making them feel like glitter rather than evidence."",
